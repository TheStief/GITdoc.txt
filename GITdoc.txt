This is the doc IÂ´m writing for my practicum.

FORK:
- you create a copy of the repository under your own github.com ID
- when you change something in your forked repository you have to make a "pull request"
	-> if approved: the changes you made will be committed with the ORIGINAL



CLONE:
- you make a copy of the repo on your PC
	-> with everything inside the repo, the history and branches etc.



the PUSH-COMMAND:

when you type " git push " you move all branches to the remote repository 
-> you sync the local repo with the remote repo



the pull request:
- in case there are many people working on one project, they all have own forks and work on these forks
-if there are many changes on one or more forks, the PULL REQUEST lets everyone know that they have to sync all he forks to get the latest version



GITCONFIG:
two config files: .gitconfig	.git/config

.gitconfig:
- global settings
	-> directory: /home/stefan/

.git/config:
-repository specific settings


-with "gitconfig" you can config git and change the settings
